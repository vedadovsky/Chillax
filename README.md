Info: Due to me seeing in the last moment (2 days before deadline) that besides mobile app a web app is needed I didn't finish in time fixing the search functionality for mobile app, as well as movie/tv series details part on the web. You can check that there is a "ghost" placeholder if you add /details in the end of the url (ex. http://localhost:3000/details). The search functionality in web isn't completely done but its functional where you can search for movies/tv series in the search bar, after entering what you want to search you need to press enter button to search. For any more questions please contact me.
